class _FLExUndoableOperation:
    """
    Context manager for undoable operations that appear in FLEx's Ctrl+Z menu.

    Unlike Phase 1 Transaction (rollback-only), Phase 2 UndoableOperation:
    - Changes made inside the block appear as ONE named operation in FLEx Ctrl+Z
    - Ctrl+Z in FLEx will undo the entire operation
    - Ctrl+Y in FLEx will redo the entire operation
    - The project MUST be opened with undoable=True

    Usage::

        project.OpenProject("MyProject", writeEnabled=True, undoable=True)

        with project.UndoableOperation("Add entry 'run'"):
            entry = project.LexEntry.Create("run", "stem")
            project.Senses.Create(entry, "to move", "en")

        # Now "Add entry 'run'" appears in FLEx Edit > Undo menu
        # User can Ctrl+Z to undo both the entry AND sense creation together

    Note:
        This class is internal. Obtain instances via FLExProject.UndoableOperation().
        Requires the project to be opened with undoable=True.
