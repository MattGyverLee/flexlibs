"""
Smart collection class for allomorphs.

This module provides AllomorphCollection, a smart collection that manages
allomorphs while showing type diversity and supporting unified operations
across the two concrete types:
- MoStemAllomorph
- MoAffixAllomorph

Problem:
    GetAll() returns objects with multiple concrete implementations. Users
    need to:
    - See which types are in the collection
    - Filter by type if they want to
    - Work with all types together without manual casting
    - Filter by common properties that work across all types

Solution:
    AllomorphCollection provides:
    - __str__() showing type breakdown
    - by_type() filtering to specific concrete types
    - filter() for common criteria (form_contains, environment, type)
    - Convenience methods (stem_allomorphs(), affix_allomorphs())
    - Chainable filtering: allomorphs.stem_allomorphs().filter(form_contains='ing')

Example::

    from flexlibs2.code.Lexicon.allomorph_collection import AllomorphCollection

    # GetAll() now returns AllomorphCollection
    allomorphs = allomorphOps.GetAll(entry)
    print(allomorphs)  # Shows type breakdown
    # AllomorphCollection (8 total)
    #   MoStemAllomorph: 5 (62%)
    #   MoAffixAllomorph: 3 (38%)

    # Filter by type
    stems = allomorphs.stem_allomorphs()
    print(len(stems))  # 5

    # Filter by form
    ing_allomorphs = allomorphs.filter(form_contains='ing')

    # Chain filters
    ing_stems = allomorphs.stem_allomorphs().filter(form_contains='ing')

    # Iterate
    for allomorph in allomorphs:
        print(allomorph.form)

    Smart collection for allomorphs with type-aware filtering.

    Manages collections of allomorph (Allomorph wrapper objects) with

    Attributes:

        Supports filtering by properties that work across all allomorph types
        (form, environment). For complex filtering, use where().

        Args:
            form_contains (str, optional): Filter to allomorphs whose form contains
                this string (case-sensitive).
            environment: Filter by environment object or GUID. Can be an IPhEnvironment
                object or the environment GUID as string.
            where (callable, optional): Custom predicate function. If provided,
                other criteria are ignored.
