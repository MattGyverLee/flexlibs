#          Manages inflection classes (IMoInflClass) under MorphologicalDataOA
#          and the morphosyntactic feature system (MsFeatureSystemOA), which
#          owns IFsClosedFeature definitions and their IFsSymFeatVal value
#          children. The MGA EticGlossList.xml catalog is the canonical
#          source for the standard set of inflection (morphosyntactic)
#          features and their values; ImportCatalog / CreateFromCatalog /
#          FixGuidsAgainstCatalog populate the project from it.

    This class provides operations for managing inflection classes, feature
    structures, and features in a FieldWorks project.

    Inflection classes group lexical items that inflect similarly (e.g., Latin
    noun declensions, Spanish verb conjugations). Feature structures and features
    represent grammatical properties like person, number, gender, tense, aspect,
    mood, etc.

    Usage::

        from flexlibs2 import FLExProject, InflectionFeatureOperations

        project = FLExProject()
        project.OpenProject("my project", writeEnabled=True)

        inflOps = InflectionFeatureOperations(project)

        for ic in inflOps.InflectionClassGetAll():

    # --- CatalogBackedMixin configuration ------------------------------

    # parse_etic_gloss_list (shared with PhonFeats since both catalogs use
    # the eticGlossList shape). FW writes BARE entry ids (no "INFL:"
    # prefix) to CatalogSourceId; the mixin honours that with
    # CATALOG_PREFIX_WRITE = None. Features are flat (each top-level
    # feature entry owns IFsSymFeatVal value children handled by
    # _handle_entry_children), so the recursive-entries flag is off.
    # The catalog also contains type="fsType"/"complex" items; the
    # parser silently skips them, so Phase 6a only imports closed
    # (symbolic) features. Complex-feature import is deferred.
