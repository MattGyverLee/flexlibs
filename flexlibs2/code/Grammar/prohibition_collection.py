"""
Smart collection class for ad hoc morphosyntactic prohibitions.

This module provides ProhibitionCollection, a smart collection that manages
ad hoc prohibitions while showing type diversity and supporting unified
operations across the three concrete types:
- MoAdhocProhibGr (Grammatical feature prohibitions)
- MoAdhocProhibMorph (Morpheme co-occurrence prohibitions)
- MoAdhocProhibAllomorph (Allomorph co-occurrence prohibitions)

Problem:
    GetAllAdhocCoProhibitions() returns objects with multiple concrete
    implementations. Users need to:
    - See which types are in the collection
    - Filter by type if they want to
    - Work with all types together without manual casting
    - Filter by common properties that work across all types

Solution:
    ProhibitionCollection provides:
    - __str__() showing type breakdown
    - by_type() filtering to specific concrete types
    - filter() for filtering by prohibition type
    - grammatical_prohibitions(), morpheme_prohibitions(),
      allomorph_prohibitions() convenience filters
    - where() for custom filtering
    - Chainable filtering: prohibitions.morpheme_prohibitions()

Example::

    from flexlibs2.code.Grammar.prohibition_collection import ProhibitionCollection

    # GetAllAdhocCoProhibitions() now returns ProhibitionCollection
    prohibitions = morphRuleOps.GetAllAdhocCoProhibitions()
    print(prohibitions)  # Shows type breakdown
    # ProhibitionCollection (12 total)
    #   MoAdhocProhibGr: 5 (42%)
    #   MoAdhocProhibMorph: 4 (33%)
    #   MoAdhocProhibAllomorph: 3 (25%)

    # Filter by type
    morph_only = prohibitions.morpheme_prohibitions()
    print(len(morph_only))  # 4

    # Filter by custom predicate
    named_prohibitions = prohibitions.where(lambda p: p.guid is not None)

    # Chain filters
    morph_with_guid = prohibitions.morpheme_prohibitions().where(
        lambda p: p.guid is not None
    )

    # Iterate
    for prohib in prohibitions:
        print(prohib.prohibition_type)

        Filter the collection by prohibition type.

        Supports filtering by prohibition type (grammatical, morpheme,
        allomorph). For complex filtering, use where().

        Args:
            prohibition_type (str, optional): Filter by type. Accepts:

                prohibition_type is ignored.
