"""
Smart collection class for phonological rules.

This module provides RuleCollection, a smart collection that manages
phonological rules while showing type diversity and supporting unified
operations across the three concrete types:
- PhRegularRule
- PhMetathesisRule
- PhReduplicationRule

Problem:
    GetAll() returns objects with multiple concrete implementations. Users
    need to:
    - See which types are in the collection
    - Filter by type if they want to
    - Work with all types together without manual casting
    - Filter by common properties that work across all types

Solution:
    RuleCollection provides:
    - __str__() showing type breakdown
    - by_type() filtering to specific concrete types
    - filter() for common criteria (name_contains, direction, stratum)
    - Convenience methods (regular_rules(), metathesis_rules(), redup_rules())
    - Chainable filtering: rules.regular_rules().filter(name_contains='voicing')

Example::

    from flexlibs2.code.Grammar.rule_collection import RuleCollection

    # GetAll() now returns RuleCollection
    rules = phonRuleOps.GetAll()
    print(rules)  # Shows type breakdown
    # RuleCollection (12 total)
    #   PhRegularRule: 7 (58%)
    #   PhMetathesisRule: 3 (25%)
    #   PhReduplicationRule: 2 (17%)

    # Filter by type
    regular_only = rules.regular_rules()
    print(len(regular_only))  # 7

    # Filter by name
    voicing_rules = rules.filter(name_contains='voicing')

    # Chain filters
    voicing_regular = rules.regular_rules().filter(name_contains='voicing')

    # Iterate
    for rule in rules:
        print(rule.name)

    common properties (name, direction, stratum) and by concrete type.

    Attributes:
        _items: List of PhonologicalRule wrapper objects

        Filter the collection by common rule properties.

        Supports filtering by properties that work across all rule types
        (name, direction, stratum). For complex filtering, use where().

        Args:
            name_contains (str, optional): Filter to rules whose name contains
                this string (case-sensitive).
            direction (int, optional): Filter by direction (0=L-R, 1=R-L, 2=simultaneous).
            stratum: Filter by stratum object or GUID. Can be an IMoStratum
                object or the stratum GUID as string.
            where (callable, optional): Custom predicate function. If provided,
                other criteria are ignored.

        Returns:
            RuleCollection: New collection with filtered items.

        Example::
