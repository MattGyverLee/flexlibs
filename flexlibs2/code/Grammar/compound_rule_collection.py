"""
Smart collection class for compound rules.

This module provides CompoundRuleCollection, a smart collection that manages
compound rules while showing type diversity and supporting unified operations
across the two concrete types:
- MoEndoCompound
- MoExoCompound

Problem:
    GetAll() returns objects with multiple concrete implementations. Users
    need to:
    - See which types are in the collection
    - Filter by type if they want to
    - Work with all types together without manual casting
    - Filter by common properties that work across all types

Solution:
    CompoundRuleCollection provides:
    - __str__() showing type breakdown
    - by_type() filtering to specific concrete types
    - filter() for common criteria (name_contains, head_dependency)
    - Convenience methods (endo_compounds(), exo_compounds())
    - Chainable filtering: rules.endo_compounds().filter(name_contains='V')
    - where() for custom predicates

Example::

    from flexlibs2.code.Grammar.compound_rule_collection import CompoundRuleCollection

    # GetAll() now returns CompoundRuleCollection
    rules = morphRuleOps.GetAll()
    print(rules)  # Shows type breakdown
    # CompoundRuleCollection (8 total)
    #   MoEndoCompound: 5 (62%)
    #   MoExoCompound: 3 (38%)

    # Filter by type
    endo_only = rules.endo_compounds()
    print(len(endo_only))  # 5

    # Filter by name
    verb_rules = rules.filter(name_contains='Verb')

    # Chain filters
    verb_endo = rules.endo_compounds().filter(name_contains='Verb')

    # Iterate
    for rule in rules:
        print(rule.name)

    Smart collection for compound rules with type-aware filtering.

    Manages collections of compound rules (CompoundRule wrapper objects)
    with type-aware display and filtering capabilities. Supports filtering by
    common properties (name, head_dependency) and by concrete type.

    Attributes:
        _items: List of CompoundRule wrapper objects

    Example::

        rules = morphRuleOps.GetAll()  # Returns CompoundRuleCollection
        print(rules)  # Shows type breakdown
        endo = rules.endo_compounds()  # Filter to MoEndoCompound

        Initialize a CompoundRuleCollection.

        Args:

        Filter the collection by common rule properties.

        Supports filtering by properties that work across all rule types
        (name, head_dependency). For complex filtering, use where().

        Args:
            name_contains (str, optional): Filter to rules whose name contains
                this string (case-sensitive).
            head_dependency (int, optional): Filter by head dependency value.
