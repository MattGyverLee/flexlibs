    Localized possibility-list translation-pack imports.

    Translation packs ship at
    ``<FWCodeDir>/Templates/LocalizedLists-<lang>.zip`` and carry Name
    and Abbreviation alternatives for the canonical possibility lists
    shared across LangProject and LexDb (SemanticDomains, AnthroList,
    DomainTypes, UsageTypes, RestrictionsList, ...). Items are matched
    by canonical GUID, so the corresponding ``ImportCatalog`` call
    must have already seeded those items in English before
    translations can land.

    Access via ``FLExProject.LocalizedLists`` -- a lazy property.

    Usage::

        from flexlibs2 import FLExProject

        project = FLExProject()
        project.OpenProject("MyProject", writeEnabled=True)

        # Seed canonical SemDom items in English first.
        project.SemanticDomains.ImportCatalog()

        # Layer translations for one specific WS.
        project.LocalizedLists.Import("fr")

        # Or fan out across every enabled analysis WS that has a
        # shipping pack:
        result = project.LocalizedLists.ImportForAllAnalysisWritingSystems()
        print(result.imported)  # e.g. ["en", "fr"]
        for code, reason in result.skipped:
            print(f"  skipped {code}: {reason}")

        Import the localized-lists ZIP for a target writing system.

        Wraps ``XmlTranslatedLists.ImportTranslatedListsForWs`` --
        LCM's purpose-built importer for translated lists. Unlike
        ``XmlList.ImportList`` (which appends new items), this method
        merges Name / Abbreviation alternatives onto existing items
        by canonical GUID; no duplicates are created.

        Order matters: call after ``*Operations.ImportCatalog`` has
        seeded canonical items, never before. Translation packs match
        by canonical GUID and silently ignore GUIDs they don't carry,
        so calling Import before the catalog leaves nothing to merge
        onto.

        Args:
            language_code (str): ISO writing-system code identifying
                which LocalizedLists-XX.zip to import. Examples:
                ``"fr"``, ``"es"``, ``"ar"``, ``"zh-CN"``.
            progress: Optional ``SIL.LCModel.Utils.IProgress`` instance
                for progress reporting. ``None`` (default) skips
                reporting.

        Raises:
            FP_ReadOnlyError: If the project is not opened with
                writeEnabled=True.
            FP_NullParameterError: If ``language_code`` is None.
            FP_ParameterError: If ``language_code`` is empty.
            FP_FileNotFoundError: If the corresponding ZIP is not
                found in the FieldWorks Templates directory.

        Example:
            >>> project.OpenProject("MyProject", writeEnabled=True)
            >>> project.SemanticDomains.ImportCatalog()
            >>> project.LocalizedLists.Import("fr")
            >>> project.LocalizedLists.Import("es")

        Notes:
            Translation packs match by canonical GUID and silently
            ignore GUIDs they don't recognise (and silently leave
            GUIDs they don't carry untranslated). Catalog skew is
            therefore invisible at the call site. The biggest known
            case: ``OCM-Frame.xml`` (loaded via
            ``AnthropologyOperations.ImportFrameCatalog``) carries
            116 GUIDs that ``OCM.xml`` does not. Pairing the wrong
            catalog with the wrong pack leaves part of AnthroListOA
            untranslated without any warning. (issue #82)

        Import LocalizedLists translation packs for every enabled
        analysis writing system whose ``IcuLocale`` matches a shipping
        ``LocalizedLists-<IcuLocale>.zip``.

        Iterates ``project.ServiceLocator.WritingSystems
        .CurrentAnalysisWritingSystems`` and dispatches
        ``Import(ws.IcuLocale)`` for each entry. WSes whose
        ``IcuLocale`` does not map to a shipping ZIP are reported in
        the ``skipped`` field of the returned result rather than
        silently ignored.

        Convenience wrapper over ``Import`` that closes the typical
        post-ImportCatalog gap: a user enables an analysis WS
        (Portuguese, French, ...), runs ``SemanticDomains
        .ImportCatalog`` and then expects the catalog items to carry
        translations for every WS they've enabled.

        Important: this does NOT back-fill translations for analysis
        WSes that get enabled AFTER catalog content is added. Re-run
        this method (or call ``Import(code)`` directly) after enabling
        additional analysis WSes.

        Precondition: at least one ``ImportCatalog`` call should have
        run first -- the merger has nothing to land on otherwise. A
        ``logger.warning`` is emitted if ``SemanticDomainsOA`` is
        empty when this method is invoked.

        Args:
            progress: Optional ``SIL.LCModel.Utils.IProgress`` instance
                passed through to each ``Import`` call.

        Returns:
            ImportLocalizedListsResult: Named tuple with
            ``imported`` (list[str] of IcuLocale codes that merged
            successfully) and ``skipped`` (list[SkippedWS] of
            ``SkippedWS(code, reason)`` entries for WSes that did not
            apply).

        Raises:
            FP_ReadOnlyError: If the project is not write-enabled.

        Warns:

                onto. Raised via ``warnings.warn`` so it surfaces in
                interactive REPL use.
