# Phase 0 Verification - Complete Documentation

Welcome to Phase 0 of the flexlibs2 code quality improvement initiative. This directory contains all verification tests and findings before implementing quality improvements.

---

## Quick Start

### To Run the Verification Script

```bash
cd /d/Github/flexlibs2
python tests/manual_verification.py
```

**Expected output:** All 5 tests pass in ~3 seconds

---

## What is Phase 0?

Phase 0 is a **verification-only phase** designed to test all assumptions before writing production code. No code is modified during Phase 0 - only assumptions are tested.

### Goal
Ensure we understand:
- ✅ What exceptions are actually thrown
- ✅ How APIs actually work (not how we think they work)
- ✅ What patterns are safe to implement
- ✅ What operation sequences are safe
- ✅ What needs to be fixed before Phase 1

---

## Phase 0 Deliverables

This directory contains four files documenting Phase 0:

### 1. **tests/manual_verification.py** (398 lines)
The actual verification script with 5 focused tests.

**Tests included:**
- `verify_exception_types()` - What exceptions does FLEx throw?
- `verify_sense_lookups()` - How to access PossibilityLists?
- `verify_homograph_logic()` - Is HomographNumber accessible?
- `verify_property_aliases()` - Does @property pattern work?
- `verify_safe_operations()` - What sequences are safe?

**Run it yourself:**
```bash
python tests/manual_verification.py
```

## Key Findings Summary

### ✅ Verified Assumptions (Safe to proceed)

1. **Property access works** - Can read HomographNumber, LexemeFormOA
2. **Collections are iterable** - LexEntry.GetAll() returns iterable collection
3. **@property pattern is safe** - Can safely use Python @property with LCM objects
4. **Read operations are safe** - No special cleanup or handling needed
5. **Safe operation sequences documented** - Tested and verified

### ❌ Incorrect Assumptions (Must fix before Phase 1)

1. **Exception types are .NET, not Python**
   - ❌ NOT: `except KeyError` for invalid HVO lookup
   - ✅ YES: `except System.Collections.Generic.KeyNotFoundException`
   - ❌ NOT: `except ValueError` for bad DateTime
   - ✅ YES: `except System.FormatException`
   - **Impact:** Update all error handlers in core and operations classes

2. **PossibilityLists is not directly iterable**
   - ❌ NOT: `list(project.PossibilityLists)` works
   - ✅ YES: Returns `PossibilityListOperations` wrapper
   - **Impact:** Need to determine and implement correct API pattern

### ⚠️ Needs Further Investigation

1. **Write operations** - All tests ran read-only, write mode needs testing
2. **Transaction methods** - BeginUndoTask pattern needs verification in write mode
3. **Delete operations** - Dependencies and safe deletion order need testing

## Test Results

### All Tests Passed ✅

| Test | Status | Key Finding |
|------|--------|-------------|
| verify_exception_types | ✅ PASS | KeyNotFoundException (not KeyError) |
| verify_sense_lookups | ✅ PASS | API needs pattern determination |
| verify_homograph_logic | ✅ PASS | HomographNumber property works |
| verify_property_aliases | ✅ PASS | @property pattern is safe |
| verify_safe_operations | ✅ PASS | Safe sequences documented |

**Overall Result: 5/5 tests passed ✅**

## Critical Actions Before Phase 1

1. **[CRITICAL]** Update exception handling
   - Change `except KeyError` to catch `.NET KeyNotFoundException`
   - Change `except ValueError` to catch `System.FormatException`
   - Files: `core/exceptions.py`, `core/validators.py`, all operations classes

2. **[HIGH]** Determine PossibilityList API
   - Research `PossibilityListOperations` structure
   - Find correct method for accessing possibility lists
   - Create lookup utility function in `core/resolvers.py`

3. **[MEDIUM]** Create write operation tests
   - Tests with `writeEnabled=True`
   - Verify transaction model (BeginUndoTask/EndUndoTask)
   - Test SaveChanges() persistence

---

## Files Requiring Updates (by Phase 1)

### Core Infrastructure
- [ ] `core/exceptions.py` - Map .NET exceptions
- [ ] `core/validators.py` - Update validation error handling
- [ ] `core/resolvers.py` - Update lookup error handling and add PossibilityList utility

### Operations Classes
- [ ] `flexlibs2/code/BaseOperations.py` - Add transaction support
- [ ] All operation classes - Update exception handling
- [ ] Classes doing DateTime parsing - Update exception handling

### Documentation
- [ ] `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` - Update with corrected exceptions
- [ ] Create `API_PATTERNS.md` with verified patterns
- [ ] Create `SAFE_OPERATIONS_GUIDE.md`

## Code Examples

### Correct Exception Handling (Fixed in Phase 1)

```python
# OLD (WRONG - doesn't catch .NET exceptions):
try:
    obj = project.Object(invalid_hvo)
except KeyError:
    raise ObjectNotFoundError(...)

# NEW (CORRECT - catches actual .NET exception):
from System.Collections.Generic import KeyNotFoundException

try:
    obj = project.Object(invalid_hvo)
except KeyNotFoundException as e:
    raise ObjectNotFoundError(...) from e
```

### @property Pattern (Verified Safe)

```python
# This pattern works and is safe to use:
class EntryWrapper:
    def __init__(self, lcm_entry):
        self._entry = lcm_entry

    @property
    def homograph_number(self):
        """Get homograph number safely."""
        return self._entry.HomographNumber

    @property
    def form(self):
        """Get lexeme form safely."""
        return str(self._entry)

# Usage - Works as expected:
wrapper = EntryWrapper(entry)
num = wrapper.homograph_number  # ✅ Works!
form = wrapper.form              # ✅ Works!
```

### Safe Read Operations (Verified)

```python
# This pattern is safe and efficient:
# 1. Get collection
entries = project.LexEntry.GetAll()

# 2. Iterate
for entry in entries:
    # 3. Access properties
    num = entry.HomographNumber
    form = str(entry)

# 4. No cleanup needed for read-only
```

## Questions Answered by Phase 0

### Q: Can I use Python @property decorators with FLEx objects?
**A:** ✅ Yes! @property pattern is safe and works as expected.

### Q: Is it safe to read properties directly?
**A:** ✅ Yes! HomographNumber, LexemeFormOA, and other properties are accessible.

### Q: What exceptions does FLEx throw?
**A:** ⚠️ .NET exceptions! KeyNotFoundException (not KeyError), System.FormatException (not ValueError).

### Q: Can I iterate through collections?
**A:** ✅ Yes! LexEntry.GetAll() returns an iterable collection.

### Q: Do I need special cleanup for read-only operations?
**A:** ✅ No! Read operations are clean and simple.

### Q: How do I access PossibilityLists?
**A:** ⚠️ Needs further research - not directly iterable, returns operations wrapper.

### Q: Is my implementation plan still valid?
**A:** 🟡 Mostly yes, but exception types need fixing - update error handlers!
