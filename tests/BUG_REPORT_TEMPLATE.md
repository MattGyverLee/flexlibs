## Impact

### Severity
- [ ] **Critical** - Blocks release (data corruption, crash, core functionality broken)
- [ ] **High** - Major functionality broken (no workaround available)
- [ ] **Medium** - Functionality impaired (workaround available)
- [ ] **Low** - Cosmetic, edge case, or minor issue

### Priority
- [ ] **P0** - Fix immediately (data loss risk)
- [ ] **P1** - Fix before release (blocks testing)
- [ ] **P2** - Fix in next sprint (reduces functionality)
- [ ] **P3** - Fix when time permits (nice to have)

### Affected Areas
- [ ] Create operations
- [ ] Find operations
- [ ] GetAll operations
- [ ] Delete operations
- [ ] Property get/set
- [ ] Parent-child relationships
- [ ] Cross-references
- [ ] Writing system handling
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] FLEx GUI display
- [ ] Data persistence
- [ ] Export/import

### User Impact
```
[Describe how this bug affects users]

Example:
- Users cannot create scripture books via flexlibs
- Workaround: Use FLEx GUI to create books manually
- Blocks automated scripture import workflows
```

---

## Root Cause Analysis (if known)

**Suspected Cause**:
```
[If you've investigated, describe what you think is causing the bug]

Example:
- ServiceLocator not initialized properly
- self.project.project is None at time of factory access
- Missing initialization step in __init__
```

**Code Location**:
```
File: D:\Github\flexlibs\flexlibs\code\Scripture\ScrBookOperations.py
Line: 123
Method: Create()

Problematic code:
    factory = self.project.project.ServiceLocator.GetService(IScrBookFactory)
    # self.project.project is None here
```

---

## Suggested Fix

**Proposed Solution** (if known):
```
[Describe how this could be fixed]

Example:
1. Add null check before accessing ServiceLocator:
   if not self.project or not self.project.project:
       raise FP_ParameterError("Project not properly initialized")

2. Ensure project.project is set in FLExProject.OpenProject()

3. Add initialization verification in __init__:
   if not hasattr(self.project, 'project') or self.project.project is None:
       raise FP_ParameterError("Invalid project instance")
```

**Workaround** (temporary solution):
```
[If there's a way to work around this bug, describe it]

Example:
- Create books manually in FLEx GUI
- Use project.ObjectsIn(IScrBookRepository) to access existing books
- Wait for fix before testing Create functionality
```

---

## Testing Notes

### How Discovered
```
[Describe how this bug was found]

Example:
- Running Test_Create_MinimalBook from scripture_operations_tests.md
- Step 1 of "Scripture Import Scenario" integration test
- Manual testing of demo_scripture_operations.py
```

### Verification Steps
```
[Steps to verify the bug is fixed]

1. Run Test_Create_MinimalBook
2. Verify book object returned (not None)
3. Verify book.CanonicalNum == 1
4. Verify book in Scripture.ScriptureBooksOS
5. Open project in FLEx GUI
6. Verify book displays correctly
7. Close and reopen - verify persistence
```

### Regression Impact
```
[Could this fix break other functionality?]

Example:
- Fix should not affect other Operations classes
- May affect any code that assumes project.project is always valid
- Need to test all Create methods after fix
```
