#          Coverage for FLExProject.LocalizedLists.Import -- the
#          wrapper around XmlTranslatedLists.ImportTranslatedListsForWs
#          added to close item 3 of issue #29. Methods now live on
#          LocalizedListsOperations (issue #73) and the enumerator
#          returns a structured ImportLocalizedListsResult (issue #75).
#
#          We deliberately avoid triggering a real import against the
#          shared Sena 3 test project (the same pollution rationale as
#          AnthropologyOperations.ImportCatalog tests -- a successful
#          import mutates the project's possibility lists with
#          translation alternatives that subsequent test runs would
#          have to account for). The tests cover the input-validation
#          guards plus the FP_FileNotFoundError path for unknown
#          language codes.
