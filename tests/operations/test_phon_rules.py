class TestPhonRulesFindDeleteRegression:

    Regression coverage for issue #5: PhonologicalRule wrapper / PhonRules
    operations. Two bugs were fixed:

    Bug 1 - PhonologicalRule.name always returned "":
        wrapper used self._obj.OwnerOfClass.project.DefaultAnalWs which
        raised AttributeError (no .project on OwnerOfClass). A bare
        `except` swallowed the error and returned "". Cascading effect:
        PhonRules.Find always returned None because it compared against
        wrapper.name.
        Fix: use self._obj.Cache.DefaultAnalWs.

    Bug 2 - PhonRules.Delete(wrapper) raised TypeError:
        __ResolveObject did not unwrap PhonologicalRule wrappers, so
        ICollection.Contains was handed a Python object instead of an
        IPhSegmentRule and threw TypeError. Fix: __ResolveObject now
        duck-types on _obj/_concrete and returns the raw LCM object.

    Round-trip design: each test creates a rule, exercises the API,
    then deletes it IN THE TEST BODY and asserts it is gone. On green
    the DB is net-zero. On failure the rule stays as a diagnostic signal
    (no pre-clean at test start, no finally-cleanup on the main rule).
