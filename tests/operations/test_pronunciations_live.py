#   test_pronunciations_live.py
#
#   Class: PronunciationOperations
#          Live-DB tests against Sena 3 covering all five phases of the
#          stabilization model:
#              A. read-only
#              B. create + delete in-place (TEST_ prefix, finally cleanup)
#              C. reorder via BaseOperations.MoveUp/MoveDown
#              D. modify (capture-restore)
#              E. delete pre-existing (sandbox copy)
#
#          Pronunciations are owned by ILexEntry via entry.PronunciationsOS
#          (LcmOwningSequence<ILexPronunciation>). PronunciationOperations
#          overrides _GetSequence to return parent.PronunciationsOS, so
#          BaseOperations.MoveUp / MoveDown work directly (Phase C).
#
#          Create() follows the SAFE ordering: factory.Create() ->
#          PronunciationsOS.Add(...) -> set Form via TsStringUtils. This is
#          the opposite of the broken ordering seen in VariantOperations
#          (issue #151 / Phase B regression note in test_variants_live.py),
#          so Phase B is expected to construct the test pronunciation
#          successfully.
#
#          However, per issue #151 PronunciationOperations.Delete (L248-250),
#          Duplicate (L308 + 315/321), and GetOwningEntry (L958) still ship
#          the unfixed `.Owner-without-cast + hasattr-guarded
#          PronunciationsOS` pattern:
#
#              entry = pronunciation.Owner               # ICmObject base
#              if hasattr(entry, "PronunciationsOS"):    # False on ICmObject
#                  entry.PronunciationsOS.Remove(...)    # never executes
#
#          Phase B's `finally Delete` is therefore expected to silently
#          no-op -- the pronunciation leaks and the post-finally
#          `Count == count_before` assertion will FAIL, surfacing the
#          P1 bug as documented. Phase C cleanup, Phase D cleanup, and
#          Phase E (delete a pre-existing pronunciation) hit the same
#          shape.
