#   Class: TestSemanticDomainsCatalog
#          Phase 6b live-LCM integration tests for the new
#          SemanticDomainOperations.ImportCatalog method. Unlike
#          POS / PhonFeatures / InflectionFeatures (which use the etic
#          CatalogEntry parser), the semantic-domain catalog is consumed
#          natively by LCM's XmlList.ImportList.
#
#   IMPORTANT — Test shape rationale (project pollution + LCM non-idempotency):
#
#   LCM's XmlList.ImportList APPENDS the full SemDom hierarchy on every
#   call without GUID-based deduplication. Earlier unguarded test runs
#   left the shared test project ("Sena 3" or similar) with dozens of
#   duplicated top-level domains. The Programmer's Phase 6b fix added a
#   refuses-by-default guard: ImportCatalog raises FP_ParameterError if
#   SemanticDomainListOA.PossibilitiesOS is non-empty, unless force=True.
#
#   Because the project is permanently polluted and we cannot cheaply
#   reset it, these tests do NOT exercise a live re-import:
#
#     - We never call ImportCatalog(force=True) — that would add another
#       full ~1700-domain hierarchy and worsen the pollution.
#     - We assert the new contract directly (raises without force) and
#       verify the catalog DID land at some point by Find()-ing the
#       canonical "1" (Universe) and "1.1" (Sky) GUIDs left over from
#       earlier successful imports.
#     - We also do a static signature check that `force` is a real kwarg.
#
#   To exercise a real import end-to-end, run against a fresh empty
#   project — outside this suite.
