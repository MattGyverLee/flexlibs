#   Class: TestLexEntryDuplicateDeep
#          Regression coverage for issue #31:
#          LexEntryOperations.Duplicate(entry, deep=True) raised
#          AttributeError because _copy_sense_content in
#          LexSenseOperations called `.CopyAlternatives` on
#          duplicate.Source -- a single-string ITsString field that
#          has no multistring methods. The fix replaces the multistring
#          copy with a direct ITsString assignment.
