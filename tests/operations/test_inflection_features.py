#          catalog-backed import (issue #14 — partial). Exercises
#          CreateFromCatalog against the FW-shipped MGA EticGlossList.xml
#          catalog, confirming canonical-GUID feature + value creation,
#          prefix handling, idempotency, parser type-filtering, and — most
#          importantly — that inflection features land under
#          MsFeatureSystemOA (NOT PhFeatureSystemOA, which is the
#          phonological feature system from Phase 5b).
#
#          Mirrors the writable-project fixture pattern used by
#          tests/operations/test_phon_features.py and test_pos_catalog.py.
#          Created features and their values are tracked and removed in
#          finally blocks (cascade-delete: removing the feature from
#          FeaturesOC cascades its IFsSymFeatVal value children).
