#   Class: TestPhonemeOperationsCreateRegression
#          Phase 2 regression tests for PhonemeOperations.Create — guards
#          against the orphan-NPE bug closed by issue #6 where a freshly
#          created IPhPhoneme had `.Name.set_String(...)` called on it
#          before the phoneme was attached to its owning collection. LCM
#          forbids setting properties on an orphan object; the fix in
#          PhonemeOperations.py moves `phoneme_set.PhonemesOC.Add(...)`
#          ahead of the Name assignment.
#
#          Reproducer:
#              phoneme = project.Phonemes.Create("o")    # ASCII; NFD
#                                                        # normalization is
#                                                        # a separate Phase

    stray '***' IPhCode (FLEX null marker) on the phoneme. AddCode used
    to always append a new IPhCode, so every wrapper-created phoneme
    ended up carrying a junk placeholder code that broke HermitCrab
    parser loading.

    The Option B fix in AddCode reuses the autocreated placeholder code
    when the phoneme has exactly one code and its representation in the
    target WS is empty or '***'. Subsequent AddCode calls append
    normally, so multi-code workflows still behave.
