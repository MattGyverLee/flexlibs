#
#   Class: EtymologyOperations
#          Live-DB tests against Sena 3 covering all five phases of the
#          stabilization model:
#              A. read-only
#              B. create + delete in-place (TEST_ prefix, finally cleanup)
#              C. reorder via BaseOperations.MoveUp/MoveDown
#              D. modify (capture-restore form)
#              E. delete pre-existing (sandbox copy)
#
#          Etymologies are owned by ILexEntry via entry.EtymologyOS
#          (LcmOwningSequence<ILexEtymology>). EtymologyOperations
#          overrides _GetSequence to return parent.EtymologyOS, so
#          BaseOperations.MoveUp / MoveDown work directly (Phase C).
#
#          EtymologyOperations is CLEAN per issue #151: both Delete
#          (L277) and Duplicate (L337) use _GetTypedOwner so the
#          casting fix from #98 is already applied. Comments at
#          L272-276 and L333-335 document the post-#98 shape
#          explicitly. Phase B teardown and Phase E delete are
#          therefore expected to PASS rather than silently no-op
#          like PronunciationOperations.
#
#          Per CLAUDE.md Category 8 and EtymologyOperations.py L221
#          (`etymology.Source.set_String(...)`), Source on
#          ILexEtymology is an IMultiString -- distinct from
#          ILexSense.Source which is an ITsString. Form, Gloss,
#          Comment, and Bibliography on ILexEtymology are likewise
#          IMultiString. Phase D modifies Form via SetForm/GetForm,
#          which uses the standard get_String/set_String pair.
#
#          Create() follows the SAFE ordering: factory.Create() ->
#          EtymologyOS.Add(etym) -> set Source/Form/Gloss via
#          TsStringUtils -- the opposite of the broken ordering in
#          VariantOperations, so Phase B construction is expected to
#          succeed cleanly.
