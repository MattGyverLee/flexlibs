#   Class: TestBasicIPACatalog
#          Phase 6d live-LCM contract tests for the new
#          PhonemeOperations.ImportCatalog method (BasicIPAInfo.xml ->
#          IPhPhoneme inventory). Mirrors the test-shape rationale of
#          tests/operations/test_semantic_domains.py and
#          tests/operations/test_anthropology.py (Phase 6b/6c).
#
#   IMPORTANT — Test shape rationale (project pollution + LCM non-idempotency):
#
#   BasicIPAInfo.xml ships 245 IPA segments. Unlike GOLDEtic /
#   eticGlossList catalogs, segments have NO per-entry GUIDs and
#   IPhPhoneme has no CatalogSourceId field, so the importer's
#   idempotency strategy is "refuse on non-empty PhonemeSet unless
#   force=True" (the Phase 6b/6c SemDom / Anthro pattern).
#
#   The shared test project ("Sena 3" or similar) is in an UNKNOWN
#   pre-state with respect to PhonemesOC and PhFeatureSystemOA:
#
#     - PhonemeSetsOS[0].PhonemesOC may be empty (stock Sena 3),
#       partially populated (test fallout), or fully populated
#       (someone ran ImportCatalog successfully before).
#     - PhFeatureSystemOA may be empty (no PhonFeats import yet) or
#       populated (someone ran PhonFeatures.ImportCatalog before).
#
#   Therefore the suite intentionally:
#
#     - Never calls ImportCatalog() with the expectation that it will
#       SUCCEED. We only assert refuse-paths (FP_ParameterError) and
#       static contract.
#     - NEVER calls ImportCatalog(force=True). That would dump 245
#       phonemes into the project and worsen pollution.
#     - Gracefully skips a refuse-path test if the corresponding
#       pre-state doesn't hold (e.g. skip the "refuses on empty
#       PhonFeats" test if PhonFeats is already populated).
#
#   To exercise a real end-to-end import, run against a fresh empty
#   project — outside this suite.
