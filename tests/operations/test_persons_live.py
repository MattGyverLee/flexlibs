#
#   test_persons_live.py
#
#   Class: PersonOperations
#          Live-DB tests against Sena 3 covering the four applicable
#          phases of the stabilization model:
#              A. read-only
#              B. create + delete in-place (TEST_ prefix, finally cleanup)
#              C. reorder       -- N/A (PeopleOC is unordered)
#              D. modify (capture-restore)
#              E. delete pre-existing (sandbox copy, real target)
#
#          Sena 3 ships with 6 pre-existing CmPerson rows, which makes
#          PersonOperations the first class where Phase E has a real
#          target. The Phase E test snapshots one pre-existing person's
#          name + GUID, deletes the person inside the sena3_sandbox
#          fixture, and confirms the deletion -- never touching the
#          user's real Sena 3.
#
#          Replicates the Cycle-2 template from test_locations_live.py.
