#          Regression coverage for the `.Owner` -> typed-collection
#          casting bug across Lexicon, Notebook, and Discourse
#          operations.
#
#   Bug class (closes #97, #98, #116, #117):
#     - `obj.Owner` on an owned LCM object returns the base ICmObject
#       interface, which does NOT expose typed collection properties
#       (AlternateFormsOS, EtymologyOS, EntryRefsOS, AnnotationsOC,
#       RepliesOS, SubPossibilitiesOS, RowsOS).
#     - `hasattr(obj.Owner, "XxxOS")` therefore returns False even
#       when the concrete owner does expose the collection, which
#       silently no-ops Delete and orphans Duplicate output.
#     - Direct `obj.Owner.XxxOS.Remove(...)` raises AttributeError.
#
#   The canonical fix is to route the owner through
#   `cast_to_concrete()` (lcm_casting.py) before touching the typed
#   collection. This file locks the PATTERN, not just specific
#   instances, by:
#
#     1. Static checks that each affected Operations method's source
#        no longer relies on the broken `obj.Owner` -> hasattr pattern.
#        These run without LCM/FieldWorks installed.
#
#     2. Live behavioural checks against a writable FLEx project,
#        parametrised across all affected sites. These verify Delete
#        actually removes from the owner's typed collection and that
#        Duplicate actually attaches the duplicate to it. They skip
#        when SIL.LCModel isn't loaded.
