#
#   Class: TestNaturalClassFeatureBased
#          Phase 5d live-LCM integration tests for the feature-based
#          natural-class API added to NaturalClassOperations:
#          CreateFeatureBased, GetType, GetFeatures, SetFeatures.
#
#          Mirrors the writable-project fixture pattern used by
#          tests/operations/test_phon_features.py. Self-restoring
#          round-trips: each test deletes what it created as an in-body
#          tested step (green path only), so residue is a diagnostic
#          signal on failure rather than hidden state.

    iterates GetAll() which yields IPhNaturalClass regardless of
