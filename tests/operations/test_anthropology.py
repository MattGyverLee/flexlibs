#   Class: TestAnthropologyOCMCatalog
#          Phase 6c live-LCM integration tests for the new
#          AnthropologyOperations.ImportCatalog method. Mechanically
#          mirrors Phase 6b's SemanticDomainOperations.ImportCatalog,
#          but wraps the OCM (Outline of Cultural Materials) catalog
#          at <FWCodeDir>/Templates/OCM.xml via LCM's native
#          XmlList.ImportList("AnthroList", ...).
#
#   IMPORTANT -- Test shape rationale (project pollution + LCM non-idempotency):
#
#   LCM's XmlList.ImportList APPENDS items into AnthroListOA without
#   GUID-based deduplication. The Phase 6c implementation matches the
#   Phase 6b SemDom guard: refuses-by-default when the list is non-empty,
#   override with force=True. See test_semantic_domains.py for the
#   full discussion of why we deliberately don't trigger a fresh import
#   here -- earlier unguarded Phase 6b SemDom test runs already left the
#   shared test project polluted with 72+ duplicated top-level domains,
#   and we explicitly do NOT want to make the same mistake for OCM.
#
#   Additional wrinkle vs Phase 6b: AnthroListOA may or may NOT have
#   ever been populated in this project. Sena 3 ships with an empty
#   AnthroListOA by default (unlike SemanticDomainListOA, which is
#   commonly seeded). Therefore:
#
#     - We never call ImportCatalog(force=True) -- that would seed a
#       full OCM hierarchy and start a brand-new pollution cycle.
#     - The non-empty-guard tests are CONDITIONAL: if AnthroListOA is
#       empty at test time, the guard cannot be exercised live and we
#       pytest.skip rather than provoke an import.
#     - We do NOT add a canonical-GUID Find() probe like SemDom's
#       Find("1") test, because the canonical OCM items will be absent
#       from a project that has never had ImportCatalog run against it.
#     - We always do a pure static signature check, plus an accessor
#       hasattr check, so coverage is non-trivial even when the live
#       project is empty.
#
#   The runtime AnthroListOA count is printed to stdout via capsys so
#   reviewers can see the project state these tests ran against.
