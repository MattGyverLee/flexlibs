#
#   Class: TestPOSCatalog
#          Phase 5a (issue #14) live-LCM integration tests for the new
#          catalog-driven POS creation methods on POSOperations:
#            - CreateFromCatalog(source_id)
#            - Create(name, abbreviation, catalogSourceId="GOLD:...")
#              (enhanced to consult the catalog when the prefix is GOLD:)
#
#          Uses the same writable-project fixture pattern as
#          tests/operations/test_phon_rules.py / test_phonemes.py.
#
#          IMPORTANT: GOLDEtic 'Adjective' assigns the same canonical GUID
#          (30d07580-5052-4d91-bc24-469b8b2d7df9) every time. Re-running
#          the test suite must therefore NOT leave an Adjective POS behind
#          or idempotency tests on subsequent runs would observe pre-existing
#          state. Cleanup tracks GUIDs we created and deletes them in
#          try/finally, never touching POSs that were already in the project.
