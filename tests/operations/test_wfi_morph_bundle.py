#          Regression coverage for issue #16 Bug 2: GetGloss/SetGloss
#          previously referenced `bundle.Gloss`, a field that does not
#          exist on IWfiMorphBundle. Calls raised AttributeError on
#          every input.
#
#          The fix routes GetGloss through bundle.SenseRA.Gloss (with
#          a None-guard) and refuses SetGloss outright, since writing
#          via SenseRA would mutate shared lexical-sense state for
#          every bundle that references the sense -- a surprising
#          side effect to attach to a per-bundle setter.
