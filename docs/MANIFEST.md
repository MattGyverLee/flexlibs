# Documentation Manifest

The canonical index of every doc the `/lex-doc` agent maintains. Each entry declares its purpose, what code changes should trigger a review, and its current status.

**Statuses:**
- `live` — current, expected to track the codebase, drift counts as a bug
- `archived` — kept for history; no update triggers apply
- `template` — lives under `docs/_templates/`; updated only when the pattern it embodies changes
- `external-managed` — owned by another tool/process (e.g. Sphinx-generated reference); the agent does not edit

**Trigger format:** a list of patterns (commit subjects, changed file globs, or release events) that should cause `/lex-doc` to drift-check this entry.

## Notes for `/lex-doc`

### Resolved (2026-05-27 first-run audit)

- **`docs/API_SURFACE.md`** is generated (via `tools/extract_api_usage.py`), not maintained by drift-checking. Reclassified `external-managed`. Refreshed 2026-05-27 (files analyzed 66 -> 73; SIL imports 527 -> 569; unique classes 194 -> 233; factories 42 -> 74). Tool default code-dir was wrong (`../flexlibs/code` finds 0 files); use `--code-dir flexlibs2/code --all`.
- **`docs/FUNCTION_REFERENCE.md`** is hand-maintained. Refreshed 2026-05-27 with Phase 5/6 additions in a "Recent Additions (Post-v2.0)" supersection (+47 method entries, +232 lines). Original 14 Phase sections preserved.
- **`docs/LISTS_CONSOLIDATION_TEMPLATE.md`** was a one-time refactoring guide, not a reusable template. Refactor landed; per issue #54 the resulting `AgentOperations(PossibilityItemOperations)` inheritance turned out to be wrong, so the doc is partially superseded too. Reclassified `archived`. Not moved.

### Open follow-ups for user decision

- **`flexlibs2/__init__.py` declares version `3.0.0` but `CHANGELOG.md` latest is v2.4.0** — surfaced during the API_SURFACE refresh. Either the package version string is ahead of releases, or the CHANGELOG needs a v3.0.0 entry.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` v2.4.0/v2.4.1 duplicate + reversed dates** — filed as issue #146. Recommend verifying against `git tag --list 'v2.4*'`.
- ~~**`reports/audit/` JSON corpus**~~ — Resolved 2026-05-28. Tracked (4 files, ~300KB total). The corpus is load-bearing: `docs/audit/LCM_CAPABILITIES_AUDIT_REFERENCES.md` cites it by file:line so reproducibility across the team matters more than commit-history churn. Regenerate via `python tools/extract_api_usage.py --code-dir flexlibs2/code --all` from repo root. **Caveat:** the tool emits OS-native path separators in JSON (`code\\BaseOperations.py` on Windows, `code/BaseOperations.py` on POSIX). Refreshing on a different OS will produce a noisy diff. Either always refresh on Windows, or fix the tool to emit `as_posix()` paths (one-line change at [tools/extract_api_usage.py:120](tools/extract_api_usage.py#L120)) before adding a CI regeneration job.
- **CI-driven regeneration?** — Investigate whether `API_SURFACE.md` should be regenerated automatically (CI job) and whether `FUNCTION_REFERENCE.md` should be auto-generated from `@OperationsMethod` introspection rather than hand-maintained. Both are currently stale-by-default until someone re-runs the refresh. **Blocked on**: path-separator normalization in `extract_api_usage.py` (see corpus note above) — until the tool emits POSIX paths, any Linux-runner CI will report constant drift against the tracked Windows-generated JSONs.
- ~~**`LCM_AUDIT_*` set at repo root**~~ — Done 2026-05-27. Refreshed (counts, file lists, per-domain ops listings) and relocated to `docs/audit/` (6 files). Deep prose in `LCM_CAPABILITIES_AUDIT.md` and per-import file/line refs in `LCM_CAPABILITIES_AUDIT_REFERENCES.md` are partially refreshed — see `## TODO` blocks at the top of those docs. No inbound link rewrites needed (cross-refs between the 6 files are bare filenames). Future refreshes: `python tools/extract_api_usage.py --code-dir flexlibs2/code --all` produces the JSON corpus the audit set reads.
- **`RELEASE_NOTES_v2.3.0.md` archive move** — Done 2026-05-27. Moved to `docs/_archive/RELEASE_NOTES_v2.3.0.md` via `git mv`. Manifest path updated.
- **`history.md` archive move REVERTED 2026-05-27** — File moved back to repo root after user clarified it's a live upstream-sync surface (one of the few remaining links with cdfarrow/flexlibs upstream). Manifest entry reclassified from `archived` to `live (upstream-sync)`. Lesson: load-bearing duplicates can look archive-worthy on filename inspection alone; verify intent against upstream parity before classifying. See `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_history_md_upstream_sync.md`.

### Standing notes

- Whenever a doc is added under `docs/`, register it in the appropriate category table above in the same PR.
- Whenever a doc is retired, mark `archived` here rather than deleting the file.

## Notes for the user

This manifest is the **single source of truth** for what docs `/lex-doc` is responsible for. When a new doc is added to `docs/`, it must be registered here in the same PR. When a doc is no longer maintained, mark its status as `archived` here rather than deleting the file.

To onboard a new category: add a new `## Category` heading and table. The agent doesn't care about category boundaries — they exist for human readability.
