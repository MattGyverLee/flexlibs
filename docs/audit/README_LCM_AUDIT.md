# LCM Capabilities Audit - Complete Documentation

A comprehensive audit of all Language and Culture Model (LCM) capabilities imported into flexlibs2, their exposure through the public API, and internal usage patterns.

**Audit Date:** 2026-05-27
**Scope:** flexlibs2/code directory (106 Python files)
**Status:** REFRESHED — Ready for review

> Refreshed from the original 2025-03-16 audit. Counts, namespace breakdowns, and per-domain inventories were regenerated from the live tree via `tools/extract_api_usage.py`. The deep narrative in `LCM_CAPABILITIES_AUDIT.md` retains the original prose with refreshed numbers and a TODO block for sections that warrant a fuller rewrite.

## Key Findings

### Statistics (Refreshed 2026-05-27)
- **569 LCM import statements** importing **233 unique classes/interfaces** across **14 SIL namespaces**
- **60 user-facing Operations classes** (plus BaseOperations parent) wrapping the complexity
- **73 of 106 Python files** contain SIL imports
- **0 critical risks** identified
- **2 known TODOs** (Linux flatpak, project chooser dialog) — both still open from original audit

### Architecture Pattern
```
Users
  ↓
FLExProject.DOMAIN.METHOD()  ← 60 Operations classes (safe, documented)
  ↓
Repository/Factory/Manager   ← Wrapped LCM APIs (protected)
  ↓
SIL.LCModel (233 classes)    ← FieldWorks internals (hidden)
```

### Risk Assessment
- **Critical:** NONE - All dangerous operations are protected
- **Medium:** 2 (Direct .project access, incomplete Scripture domain) - both documented
- **Low:** Several - all handled with wrappers

### Top Recommendations
1. **[HIGH]** Document power-user LCM access patterns
2. **[MEDIUM]** Expose IFwMetaDataCacheManaged for schema introspection
3. **[MEDIUM]** Complete Scripture domain operations (improved coverage since original audit but still incomplete)
4. **[LOW]** Update Linux flatpak support
5. **[LOW]** Implement FW project chooser dialog

## Next Steps

Based on audit findings:

1. **Immediate:** Review this audit with project stakeholders
2. **This Sprint:** Implement documentation recommendations
3. **Next Sprint:** Consider IFwMetaDataCacheManaged exposure
4. **Roadmap:** Complete Scripture domain, update Linux support

See **LCM_AUDIT_SUMMARY.md** - "Recommendations Summary" for details.

## Methodology

**Approach:**
- Automated extraction via `tools/extract_api_usage.py --code-dir flexlibs2/code --all` regenerates the JSON corpus in `reports/audit/`
- File-by-file code tracing for usage patterns and TODO scan
- Cross-reference validation
- Risk categorization (manual)

**Confidence Level:** HIGH
**Coverage:** 100% of SIL imports in flexlibs2/code directory
