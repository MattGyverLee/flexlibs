## Key Findings Quick Reference

### Top 3 Strengths
1. Well-designed abstraction layer hides 233 LCM classes behind 60 Operations
2. Consistent Repository -> Factory -> Wrapper pattern
3. Strong protection for write operations and casting

### Top 2 Areas for Improvement
1. Add documentation for power-user access patterns
2. Complete Scripture domain operations (6 ops now, up from 2 in original audit, but still incomplete)

### Top 3 Risks (All Handled)
1. Direct `.project` access - Mitigated with documentation
2. Incomplete domain coverage - Documented limitation
3. Low-level casting - Wrapped and marked internal

---
